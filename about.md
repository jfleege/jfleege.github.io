<p> 
Hi! My name is Jackson Fleege, and I am a junior at the University of Illinois Urbana–Champaign double majoring in Mathematics (Data Optimization focus) and Statistics, with a minor in Computer Science. I am interested in applying mathematical and statistical reasoning to analyze data, build models, and make informed predictions about real-world systems.
</p>

<p>
My academic interests center on data analysis, statistical modeling, and data science, with particular emphasis on understanding uncertainty, evaluating model performance, and translating quantitative results into meaningful conclusions.
</p>



<h3>Research</h3>
<p> 
I am involved in undergraduate research focused on applying statistical and computational techniques to real-world datasets. Through this work, I have gained experience working with imperfect data, refining modeling assumptions, and iteratively improving analytical approaches.
</p>

<p>
My past work includes studying how students use narrative features in predictive modeling contexts. I am currently working on an extension of this project, exploring refinements to both the modeling framework and evaluation strategy.
</p>



<h3>Projects</h3>
<p>
Outside of formal coursework, I work on independent projects in areas such as predictive modeling, data visualization, and statistical inference. These projects allow me to experiment with different methodologies, assess trade-offs between model complexity and interpretability, and deepen my understanding of data-driven decision making.
</p>

<p>
A selection of my work can be found on my <a href="/projects/">Projects</a> page, with full code and documentation available on GitHub.
</p>



<h3>Outside Interests</h3>
<p>
In addition to my academic work, I am an active member of the <b>Marching Illini</b>, the University of Illinois marching band, where I perform as part of the alto saxophone section at football games and university events.
</p>

<p>
I also serve as the treasurer for <b>Philanthropic Playlist</b>, a registered student organization that organizes and performs concerts throughout the community, with proceeds donated to health-related organizations. In this role, I manage organizational finances and assist with planning and coordination of events.
</p>

<h3>Future Plans</h3>
<p>
This summer, I will be working at Aetna, a CVS Health company, as an Underwriting Intern, where I look forward to gaining experience applying quantitative methods in an industry setting.
</p>

<p> 
Looking ahead, I plan to pursue graduate study in statistics, data science, or a closely related field. I am particularly interested in programs that emphasize rigorous statistical foundations alongside applied modeling and real-world data analysis. My long-term goal is to work in a role where I can apply these quantitative methods I've learned to complex problems while continuing to refine my analytical skills to help others.
